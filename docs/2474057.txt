LNH-84 regimen: a multicenter study of intensive chemotherapy in 737 patients with aggressive malignant lymphoma.

From July 1984 to September 1987, 737 patients with aggressive malignant lymphoma (ML) were treated by an intensive regimen (LNH-84) comprising three or four courses of doxorubicin, 75 mg/m2; cyclophosphamide, 1,200 mg/m2; vindesine, 2 mg/m2 x 2; bleomycin, 10 mg x 2; and prednisolone, 60 mg/m2 x 5 (ACVB), consolidation with high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, asparaginase, and cytarabine, and a randomized late intensification with two courses of cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, teniposide, bleomycin, and prednisone (AraCVmB). Four hundred forty-two patients had intermediate-grade ML, 221 highgrade ML, and 74 unclassified ML. Most of the patients had advanced disease: stage IIE (23%), III (13%), or IV (47%); 38% disseminated nodes; 38% two or more extranodal sites; and 41% a tumoral mass greater than 10 cm. Five hundred fifty-three patients (75%) went into complete remission (CR), 63 (9%) into partial remission, 62 (8%) failed to respond, and 59 (8%) died during ACVB courses, 17 of them from progression of the disease. With a median follow-up of 23 months, the estimated 2-year overall survival time to failure (TTF), and time to relapse (TTR) survival are 67%, 56%, and 67%, respectively. Patients receiving a late intensification had the same relapse rate as the other patients. A persistent fibronecrotic mass was found in 150 patients (20%) and did not influence the relapse rate. Toxicity was mainly neutropenia and infection during the ACVB courses, with 40 patients (5%) dying from septic complications while responding to treatment. Fifty-three percent of the patients had a neutropenia less than 0.500 x 10(9)/L, 58% fever (6% grade 4), and 49% a documented infection (8% grade 4). These results obtained with the LNH-84 regimen demonstrate that this therapeutic scheme is an effective treatment for aggressive ML.
