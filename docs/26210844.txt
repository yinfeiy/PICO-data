A New Interactive Screening Test for Autism Spectrum Disorders in Toddlers.

OBJECTIVE To develop a clinically valid interactive level 2 screening assessment for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in toddlers that is brief, easily administered, and scored by clinicians.
STUDY DESIGN We describe the development, training, standardization, and validation of the Rapid Interactive Screening Test for Autism in Toddlers (RITA-T) with ASD-specific diagnostic instruments. The RITA-T can be administered and scored in 10 minutes. We studied the validity of the RITA-T to distinguish between toddlers with ASD from toddlers with developmental delay (DD)/non-ASD in an early childhood clinic. We also evaluated the test's performance in toddlers with no developmental concerns. We identified a cutoff score based on sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the RITA-T that best differentiates between ASD and DD/non-ASD.
RESULTS A total of 61 toddlers were enrolled. RITA-T scores were correlated with ASD-specific diagnostic tools (r = 0.79; P < .01) and ASD clinical diagnoses (r = 0.77; P < .01). Mean scores were significantly different in subjects with ASD, those with DD/non-ASD, and those with no developmental concerns (20.8 vs 13 vs 10.6, respectively; P < .0001). At a cutoff score of >14 , the RITA-T had a sensitivity of 1.00, specificity of 0.84, and positive predictive value of 0.88 for identifying ASD risk in a high-risk group.
CONCLUSION The RITA-T is a promising new level 2 interactive screening tool for improving the early identification of ASD in toddlers in general pediatric and early intervention settings and allowing access to treatment.
