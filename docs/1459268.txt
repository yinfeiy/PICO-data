Prospective study of short and ultrashort regimens of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in an in vitro fertilization program.

OBJECTIVE To assess the usefulness of the ultrashort regimen of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) in ovulation induction in an in vitro fertilization (IVF) program.
DESIGN A prospective randomized trial comparing short and ultrashort regimens of GnRH-a.
SETTING Aberdeen Assisted Reproduction Unit.
PATIENTS Forty-eight patients having IVF for the first time were randomized between the two protocols.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Response to ovarian stimulation and occurrence of spontaneous luteinizing hormone (LH) surges.
RESULTS In ovulation induction, fertilization, and pregnancy rates the ultrashort regimen produces results that were no different to the short regimen but it did not always prevent an LH surge.
CONCLUSION The ultrashort regimen can be a useful alternative for ovarian stimulation of patients undergoing IVF.
