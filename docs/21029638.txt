[Efficacy of paliperidone extended-release tablets in the improvement of social functions in schizophrenics: a randomized and controlled study].

OBJECTIVE To explore the efficacy of paliperidone extended-release tablets in the improvement of social functions in schizophrenics.
METHODS A total of 81 schizophrenics were randomly divided into study group with paliperidone extended-release tablets and control group with risperidone for a 12-week treatment. They were assessed and analyzed by positive and negative symptoms scales (PANSS), social disability screening schedule (SDSS) and treatment emergent symptom scale (TESS) at baseline, 6(th) weekend and 12(th) weekend.
RESULTS In study group, the factors and total scores of PANSS in the 12(th) weekend of treatment [(12.0 ± 2.8), (12.1 ± 3.6), (26.2 ± 5.0), (50.2 ± 8.7)] were all significantly lower than those at baseline [(24.7 ± 5.3), (23.8 ± 3.6), (45.0 ± 2.9), (93.5 ± 6.8)] (t = 9.60-16.78, P < 0.05). In study group, the positive factor, negative factor and total scores of PANSS in the 12(th) weekend of treatment [(12.0 ± 2.8), (12.1 ± 3.6), (50.2 ± 8.7)] were all significantly lower than those in the 6(th) weekend of treatment [(14.2 ± 1.8), (14.6 ± 2.4), (56.5 ± 6.4)] (t = 2.58-4.26, P < 0.05). In the 12(th) weekend of treatment, the factors and total scores of PANSS in study group [(12.0 ± 2.8), (12.1 ± 3.6), (26.2 ± 5.0), (50.2 ± 8.7)] were all significantly lower than those in control group [(16.9 ± 4.9), (18.7 ± 5.3), (32.5 ± 5.1), (68.1 ± 13.0)] (t = -4.28--5.67, P < 0.05). In study group, the total scores of SDSS in the 12(th) weekend of treatment (5.93 ± 2.78) were significantly lower than those at baseline (13.9 ± 3.4) (t = 10.83, P < 0.05). In study group, the total scores of SDSS in the 12(th) weekend of treatment (5.9 ± 2.8) were significantly lower than those in the 6(th) weekend of treatment (7.6 ± 2.9) (t = 5.21, P < 0.05). But there was no significant improvement in control group (t = 1.88, P > 0.05). In the 12(th) weekend of treatment, the total scores of SDSS in study group (5.9 ± 2.8) were significantly lower than those in control group (8.8 ± 2.9) (t = -4.49, P < 0.05). No severe adverse effect was reported in either group.
CONCLUSION Paliperidone extended-release tablets are effective to improve social functions and psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenics.
