A comparative study of ofloxacin and cefixime for treatment of typhoid fever in children. The Dong Nai Pediatric Center Typhoid Study Group.

BACKGROUND Despite concerns about safety in children, fluoroquinolone antibiotics have become the treatment of choice in patients with multidrug-resistant typhoid fever in Vietnam. However, quinolone-resistant strains of Salmonella typhi have recently been reported from Vietnam; and if quinolone resistance becomes established, alternative oral treatment options will be needed.
OBJECTIVE Cefixime, an orally administered third generation cephalosporin, was compared with ofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever in children.
METHODS In an open trial children with suspected typhoid fever were randomized to receive either ofloxacin (10 mg/kg/day in two divided doses) for 5 days or cefixime (20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses) for 7 days.
RESULTS S. typhi was isolated from 82 patients (44 in the cefixime group, 38 in the ofloxacin group) and 70 (85%) of the isolates were multidrug-resistant. Median (95% confidence interval, range) fever clearance times were 4.4 (4 to 5.2, 0.2 to 9.9) days for ofloxacin recipients and 8.5 (4.2 to 9, 1.8 to 15.2) days for cefixime-treated patients (P < 0.0001). There were 11 treatment failures (10 acute and one relapse) in the cefixime group and 1 acute treatment failure in the ofloxacin group (mean difference, 22%; 95% confidence interval, 9 to 36%).
CONCLUSION Short course treatment with cefixime may provide a useful alternative treatment in cases of uncomplicated typhoid fever in children, but it is less effective than short course treatment with ofloxacin.
