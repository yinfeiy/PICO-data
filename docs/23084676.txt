Hemostasis by bipolar coagulation versus suture after surgical stripping of bilateral ovarian endometriomas: a randomized controlled trial.

STUDY OBJECTIVE To estimate whether the suture of the ovary is superior to bipolar coagulation in preserving ovarian reserve in infertile women undergoing laparoscopic stripping of bilateral endometriomas.
DESIGN Randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I).
SETTING University teaching hospital.
PATIENTS 100 patients with bilateral endometriomas.
INTERVENTIONS Patients underwent stripping of bilateral endometriomas and were randomized to undergo hemostasis by use of either laparoscopic suturing (LS group) or bipolar coagulation (BC group). Changes in ovarian reserve were investigated by measuring the levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) before surgery and at 3, 6 and 12 months from surgery.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS At 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up, in both study groups, postsurgical AMH levels were significantly lower and basal FSH levels were significantly higher than before surgery. There was no significant difference in the mean percentage decrease of AMH levels in the BC group and LS group at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. The mean percentage increase in basal FSH was higher in the BC group than in the LS group at both 3-month (p = .023) and 6-month follow-up (p = .029), but not at 12-month follow-up. Pregnancy rate, time to conception, and rate of endometrioma recurrence was similar in the 2 study groups.
CONCLUSION Laparoscopic stripping of ovarian endometriotic cyst significantly decreases serum AMH levels and increases basal FSH levels independent from the method used to obtain hemostasis on the ovarian tissue.
