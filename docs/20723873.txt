A randomized study comparing the use of the Ligaclip with bipolar energy to prevent lymphocele during laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy for gynecologic cancer.

OBJECTIVE This prospective randomized pilot study compared the use of the Ligaclip (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH) with bipolar coagulation in preventing lymphoceles after laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy for gynecologic cancer.
STUDY DESIGN Thirty patients with gynecologic malignancy, who had laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy were randomly assigned for lymphadenectomy in 1 side of the pelvis using the Ligaclip, whereas, in the other side, the bipolar coagulation to seal lymphatic vessels was used.
RESULTS At ultrasound examination, we detected lymphocele in 10 patients (33%). Lymphocele developed in 9 (30%) patients on the side where laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was perfomed using bipolar coagulation, and in 1 (3.3%) patient on the side where laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed using the Ligaclip. Univariate analysis revealed that the Ligaclip's use compared with electrocoagulation in the laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy is an independent predictive factor for development of lymphocele (P = .006).
CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that the use of the Ligaclip to close lymphatic vessels may reduce the incidence of lymphoceles in patients undergoing laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy.
