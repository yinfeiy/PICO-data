Double-blind comparison of doxepin versus bupropion in outpatients with a major depressive disorder.

A double-blind controlled study comparing the effects of bupropion to doxepin in outpatients with primary depression was conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety differences between the two drugs. Following a 7-day placebo washout period, patients could be treated for up to 13 weeks on either treatment. Antidepressant response was assessed by the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales, Clinical Global Severity and Improvement Ratings, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. Comparable efficacy between the compounds was found across the 13-week study. Doxepin differed from bupropion mainly on the sleep factor of the Hamilton Depression Scale, with doxepin improving sleep to a greater extent than bupropion. Doxepin produced a greater incidence of anticholinergic side effects, including dry mouth, constipation, sleepiness, and tiredness, in comparison to bupropion. Also, increased appetite and weight gain were consistent side effects of doxepin relative to bupropion.
