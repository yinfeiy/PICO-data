Combined descriptive and explanatory information improves peers' perceptions of autism.

Authors examined the combined effects of descriptive and explanatory information on peers' perceptions and behavioral intentions toward an unfamiliar child with autism. Children (N = 576; M age = 10.06) were randomly assigned to view two videotapes of a boy engaging in typical and autistic behaviors receiving either descriptive (AUT-D) or descriptive and explanatory information (AUT-D + E). Children responded to measures of attitudes (Adjective Checklist) and behavioral intentions (Shared Activities Questionnaire). Children rated the typical boy more favorably than the boy showing autistic symptoms. When compared to descriptive information alone, the combination of descriptive and explanatory information resulted in improved third- and fourth-graders' but not fifth-graders' attitudes toward the child with autism. Combined information improved behavioral intentions across grades; however, girls (vs. boys) were more responsive to information as evidenced by differences in academic intentions. The combination of descriptive and explanatory information about autism appears to have a positive effect on children's attitudes and behavioral intentions. Implications of the findings are briefly discussed as well as study limitations and recommendations for future research.
