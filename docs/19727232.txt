[Effects of auditory integrative training on autistic children].

OBJECTIVE To explore the short-term treatment effect of the auditory integrative training on autistic children and provide them with clinical support for rehabilitative treatment.
METHODS A total of 81 cases of autistic children were selected through the standard of DSM-4 and clinical case study was used. They were divided randomly into experimental group and control one, and respectively received auditory integrative training and no training based on the multiple therapies. The patients were investigated using clinical manifestation and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and intelligence quotient (IQ) before and after six months of treatment. The effect was evaluated through the changes of clinical manifestations and scores of ABC and IQ. The changes of scores of IQ were determined with Gesell and WPPSI or WISC-R.
RESULTS Compared with 40 patients of the control group after the six months of the auditory integrative training, 41 of the experimental group had greatly improved in many aspects, such as the disorders of their language, social interactions and typical behavior symptoms while they had not changed in their abnormal behaviors. The scores of IQ or DQ had increased and scores of ABC had dropped. The differences between the two groups were greatly significant in statistics (P < 0.01). The decreasing level of both ABC scores and the increasing level of the IQ scores were negatively correlated with age, and the decreasing level of ABC scores was in line regression(positive correlation) with base IQ.
CONCLUSION The treatment of auditory integrative training (AIT) could greatly improve on language disorders, the difficulties of social interactions, typical behavior symptoms and developmental levels,therefore it is positive to the autistic children in its short-term treatment effect.
