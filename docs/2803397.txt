[The sympatho-adrenergic stress reaction in ear surgery using various anesthesia technics].

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of various anaesthetic procedures on the endocrine stress responses during ear microsurgical operations. Simple mastoidectomies, radical mastoidectomies and tympano plastics were carried out in 49 patients under the following randomised anaesthetic procedures: Group 1 halothane anaesthesia and retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with lidocaine and ornipressin (n = 14), Group 2 fentanyl anaesthesia and retroauricular anaesthesia with lidocaine and ornipressin (n = 10), Group 3 fentanyl anaesthesia and retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with lidocaine and epinephrine (n = 14), and Group 4 retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with prilocaine and epinephrine (n = 14). The plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucose, lactate and free glycerol were measured in addition to mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) immediately before anaesthesia, 10 minutes after skin incision, 10 minutes after having started bone drilling, at the end of the operation and 3 hours after operation. All data were subjected to covariance analysis including the age factor. Plasma catecholamine concentrations remained within the normal range during the investigation in patients subjected to general anaesthesia (Groups 1-3). Plasma catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) increased significantly in Group 4 (retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia). There were no group variabilities with regard to MAP and HR. The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine demonstrate a direct response to stress followed by a secondary change in glucose, lactate and free glycerol. The beneficial effect of general anaesthesia is documented by normal plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine throughout the operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
