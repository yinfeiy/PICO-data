Enhanced induction of apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma after preoperative chemotherapy with tegafur and uracil (UFT).

PURPOSE To determine if the preoperative administration of tegafur and uracil (UFT) to patients with lung adenocarcinoma could induce apoptosis.
METHODS We conducted a randomized prospective study on 30 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, divided into two groups of 15 patients each. One group received UFT 600 mg/day preoperatively for 7 consecutive days and a control group received no chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The apoptotic index (AI) was determined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method. Expression of Ki-67 was examined by immunohistochemical staining. The concentration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in tumor tissue was measured by chemical assay.
RESULTS The AI of lung adenocarcinoma cells increased significantly in the UFT-treated group but not in the control group. A significant positive correlation was seen between the AI and the 5-FU concentrations in the tumor tissue.
CONCLUSIONS The continuous oral administration of UFT for 7 days preoperatively resulted in enhanced apoptosis and a significant positive correlation between the AI and 5-FU concentrations in lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, it may be possible to evaluate the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy based on the AI.
