In school-aged children a combination of galacto-oligosaccharides and Lactobacillus GG increases bifidobacteria more than Lactobacillus GG on its own.

The aim of this study was to compare a combination of Lactobacillus GG (LGG) and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) with LGG on its own, and their effects on the intestinal microbiota in school-aged children. The randomized, double-blinded, crossover study comprised 30 healthy children. There were two 3-week study periods with a 4-week wash-out period in between. The children ingested daily 65 ml of milk-based fruit juice containing either LGG alone (6.5 x 10(9) CFU) or LGG plus 2 g of GOS. Symptom diaries were filled during the study periods. Fecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of both study periods. At the end of both study periods, the amount of bifidobacteria was significantly greater after the ingestion of LGG + GOS compared with LGG alone (geometric mean 9.33 x 10(9) vs. 4.28 x 10(9) CFU/g, p < 0.001). No significant differences were seen in the amount of lactobacilli or LGG, nor did gastrointestinal symptoms, defecation frequency, consistency of stools or ease of defecation differ between the two study periods. Ingestion of LGG combined with 2 g of GOS increased the bifidobacteria more than LGG on its own and thus GOS clearly has a prebiotic effect in children. The children tolerated well a daily intake of 2 g of GOS.
