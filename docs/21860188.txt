Effect of prophylactic amiodarone in patients with rheumatic valve disease undergoing valve replacement surgery.

The study was carried out to evaluate the effect of prophylactic single-dose intravenous amiodarone in patients undergoing valve replacement surgery. Maintenance of sinus rhythm is better than maintenance of fixed ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation (AF) especially in the presence of irritable left or right atrium because of enlargement. Fifty-six patients with valvular heart disease with or without AF were randomly divided into two groups. Group I or the amiodarone group (n=28) received amiodarone (3 mg/kg in 100 ml normal saline) and group II or the control group received same volume of normal saline. The standardized protocol for cardiopulmonary bypass was maintained for all the patients. AF occurred in 7.14% patients in group I, and in group II, 28.57% (P=0.035); ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation was observed in 21.43% patients in group I and 46.43% patients in group II (P=0.089) after release of aortic clamp. Most of the patients in group I (92.86%) maintained sinus rhythm without cardioversion or defibrillation after release of aortic cross clamp (P=0.002). Defibrillation or cardio version was needed in 7.14% patients in group I and 28.57% patients in group II (P=0.078). A single prophylactic intraoperative dose of intravenous amiodarone decreased post bypass arrhythmia in this study in comparison to the control group. Single dose of intraoperative amiodarone may be used to decrease postoperative arrhythmia in open heart surgery.
