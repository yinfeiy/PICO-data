Inhaled fluticasone reduces sputum inflammatory indices in severe bronchiectasis.

Although corticosteroid therapy might be clinically beneficial for bronchiectasis, very little is known of its effects on the inflammatory and infective markers in bronchiectasis. We have therefore performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of a 4-wk administration of inhaled fluticasone in bronchiectasis. Twenty-four patients (12 female; mean age 51 yr) were randomized into receiving either inhaled fluticasone (500 microgram twice daily) via the Accuhaler device (n = 12) or placebo. At each visit, spirometry, 24-h sputum volume, sputum leukocyte density, bacterial densities, and concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were determined. There was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in sputum leukocyte density and IL-1beta, IL-8, and LTB4 after fluticasone treatment. The fluticasone group had one and the placebo group three episodes of exacerbation. There were no significant changes in spirometry (p > 0.05) or any reported adverse reactions in either group. The results of this study show that high-dose fluticasone is effective in reducing the sputum inflammatory indices in bronchiectasis. Large-scale and long-term studies are indicated to evaluate the effects of inhaled steroid therapy on the inflammatory components in bronchiectasis.
