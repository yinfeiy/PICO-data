The effect of two types of teacher training on implementation of Smart Choices: a tobacco prevention curriculum.

This study examined the implementation phase of a four-year research project to test the effectiveness of strategies to increase diffusion of Smart Choices, a school-based tobacco prevention program. The impact on curriculum implementation of two approaches to teacher training are compared. School districts were randomly assigned to a live workshop training or video training condition. The outcome of the evaluation was teachers' implementation of Smart Choices. Results show a lower proportion of video-trained teachers implemented the curriculum, but overall completeness and fidelity of implementation for those teachers who did teach the curriculum were comparable for the two groups. Video-trained teachers, however, were less likely to use brainstorming and student presentations/role plays, two of the methods prescribed by the curriculum. Implications of the results for teacher training are discussed.
