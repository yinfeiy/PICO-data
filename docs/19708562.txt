[Effect of transcranial electrostimulation on clinical and laboratory characteristics in patients with gastric ulcer].

The study included 100 patients with gastric ulcer aged from 16 to 60 years. In 58 patients, traditional treatment was supplemented by transcranial electrotherapy using a TRANSAIR-02 apparatus. Laboratory studies included measurements of lactoferrin (LF) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), besides standard analyses. Combined treatment (traditional therapy plus electrostimulation) resulted in a significant reduction in duration of the main symptoms of the gastric ulcer depending on the severity of ulceration process, patients' age and sex. Moreover, it facilitated ulcer scarring and had beneficial effect on dynamics of serum LF and TNF-alpha levels.
