[Observation on therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture plus blood-letting puncture and cupping combined with diet intervention for treatment of acute gouty arthritis].

OBJECTIVE To explore a more effective therapy for acute gouty arthritis.
METHODS Sixty cases were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 30 cases in eachgroup. On the basis of diet intervention, the observation group was treated with electroacupuncture at local points combined with blood-letting puncture and cupping, and the control group with oral administration of Probenecid. Their therapeutic effects were ob served.
RESULTS The effective rate was 96.7% in the observation group which was better than 86.7% in the control group (P < 0.01). After treatment, blood uric acid decreased significantly in the two groups (both P < 0.01), the observed group being lower than the control group (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION On the basis of diet intervention, electroacupuncture plus blood-letting puncture and cupping is a better therapy for acute gouty arthritis.
