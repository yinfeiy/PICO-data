Interventions in the initial prodromal states of psychosis in Germany: concept and recruitment.

BACKGROUND The Early Detection and Intervention Programme of the German Research Network on Schizophrenia (GRNS) investigates the initial prodromal phase of psychosis in a multidimensional approach. Two intervention strategies are being studied by two large-scale multicentre projects.
AIMS To present the concept of the intervention studies, and to provide an interim report of the recruitment procedure.
METHOD Comprehensive cognitive-behavioural therapy has been developed for patients in the "early initial prodromal state". For patients in the "late initial prodromal state" the atypical neuroleptic amisulpride is explored. Both interventions are evaluated in randomised controlled trials using clinical management as the control condition.
RESULTS Between January 2001 and March 2003, 1212 individuals seeking help for mental health problems were screened for putative prodromal symptoms at four university centres. More than 388 individuals fulfilled criteria for both interventions and 188 (48.5%) gave informed consent to participate in the trials.
CONCLUSIONS The screening procedure appears to be feasible and trial participation seems to be acceptable to a relevant proportion of people at increased risk of developing psychosis.
