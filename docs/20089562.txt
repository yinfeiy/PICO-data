Epirubicin and cyclophosphamide versus epirubicin and docetaxel as first-line therapy for women with metastatic breast cancer: final results of a randomised phase III trial.

BACKGROUND This randomised phase III trial was carried out to compare the efficacy and safety of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) with epirubicin and docetaxel (Taxotere) (ED) as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients (n = 240) were randomly assigned to receive either ED (epirubicin 75 mg/m(2) and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2)) or EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)). The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.
RESULTS ORR for patients randomly assigned to receive EC and ED were 42% and 47%, respectively (P = 0.63). Median PFS [10.1 versus 10.3 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.98; log-rank P = 0.38] and OS (19.9 versus 30.0 months; HR 0.663; log-rank P = 0.21) were comparable in both arms. Although grade 3/4 leucopenia occurred more frequently with ED (81% versus 73%; P = 0.01), there were no significant differences in the incidence of febrile neutropenia and grade 3/4 infections. Grade 3/4 non-haematologic toxicity was infrequent in both arms. Congestive heart failure was observed in one patient in each arm.
CONCLUSION In this randomised trial, no differences in the efficacy study end points were observed between the two treatment arms.
