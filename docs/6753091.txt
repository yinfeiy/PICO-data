A randomized trial of intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate after polypectomy.

Beneficial effects of intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate (Bdp) in patients with nasal polyposis have been reported earlier. This study was carried out to investigate whether long-term treatment with Bdp after polypectomy could prevent formation of new polyps and reduce the number of surgical removals. Forty consecutive patients without laboratory or other clinical signs of allergy but with severe nasal polyposis were included in the study. Twenty patients were treated with intranasal Bdp and twenty patients received no treatment after polypectomy. All patients were followed for at least 2.5 years. The size of the polyps that recurred was estimated at different time-intervals by the examining doctor. After six months there was already a significant difference in favour of the group treated with intranasal Bdp. Further results of the study and the clinical implications are discussed.
