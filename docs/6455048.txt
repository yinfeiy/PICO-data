Relief of osteoporotic backache with fluoride, calcium, and calciferol.

In a prospective randomized clinical trial comprising 22 postmenopausal women with backache and a halisteretic spine with crush fracture(s), 12 women completed a 12-week therapy with sodium fluoride, calcium and calciferol and 10 with placebo. A statistically significant improvement (p less than 0.05), evaluated by a four-stage scale on pains, infirmity, and consumption of analgesics, was observed in the actively treated patients.
