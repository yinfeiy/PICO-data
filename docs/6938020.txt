EORTC protocols in prostatic cancer. An interim report.

Two parallel prospective randomized studies have been undertaken by the EORTC Urological Group in previously untreated patients with prostatic cancer in order to compare low dose Stilboestrol versus Cyproterone acetate versus Medroxyprogesterone acetate in the first trial, and Stilboestrol versus Estracyt in the second trial. Although the follow up is still short, no superiority of the other drugs over Stilboestrol had appeared so far with regard to either objective response or significant side effects apart from gynaecomastia. In the third trial, patients with advanced disease no longer responsive to hormonal treatment were randomized to either Adriamycin or Procarbazine. Toxicity and early death were particularly frequent in Procarbazine treated patients, whereas most patients progressed in both treatment groups.
