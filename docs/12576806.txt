Is a 2-week duration sufficient for stenting in endopyelotomy?

PURPOSE Internal stenting is an integral part of endopyelotomy. Studies in animals show good healing after 1 to 2 weeks of ureterotomy. Inherent stent related problems warrant a minimum possible duration of stenting without compromising the results of endopyelotomy. We performed a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the optimum duration of stenting after endopyelotomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 57 consecutive patients with primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction were randomized to undergo 7/14Fr internal endopyelotomy stent placement for 2 (group 1) and 4 (group 2) weeks. A symptom based questionnaire was administered to all patients at stent removal. Followup was done with diuretic scanning at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and then yearly, and thereafter with diuretic renography.
RESULTS In each group 26 patients were available for evaluation. The 2 groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, symptoms and ipsilateral glomerular filtration rate. Mean followup was 22.3 (range 12 to 36) and 21.3 months (range 12 to 35) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. At the end of 1 year 24 group 1 (92.3%) and 23 group 2 (90.3%) patients had an improved drainage pattern. This difference was not significant. Stent related symptoms were present in a good proportion of patients in groups 1 and 2 but there was a significant difference in the incidence of urinary tract infections (11.5% versus 38.1%, p = 0.04). Of the group 2 patients 64% preferred 2 weeks of stenting.
CONCLUSIONS Two weeks seems to be a sufficient duration to allow functional restoration across the ureteropelvic junction after endopyelotomy and decrease stent related complications.
