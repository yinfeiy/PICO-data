The effects of sevoflurane and isoflurane on recovery from outpatient surgery.

This randomized, open-label study compared the investigational inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane with isoflurane in 47 healthy women undergoing elective ambulatory surgery. The women were randomized to receive either sevoflurane or isoflurane in 60% nitrous oxide-oxygen. Induction with thiopental 3-6 mg/kg was followed by vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg and fentanyl 0-200 micrograms. Duration of anesthesia, time to emergence, orientation, length of stay in the surgical unit, and hospital discharge were recorded. The emergence, length of stay, and discharge times after discontinuation of sevoflurane were 9.7 +/- 0.7, 120.6 +/- 8.0, and 244 +/- 15 minutes, respectively, and for isoflurane were 11.9 +/- 1.4, 106.8 +/- 7.1, and 282 +/- 24 minutes, respectively (NS). The isoflurane group had a higher frequency of postoperative cough. At the end of surgery, the sevoflurane group received a deeper level of anesthesia (minimum alveolar concentration 1.5 vs 1.3), however, these patients were oriented earlier (13.6 +/- 1.1 min vs 17.0 +/- 1.5 min isoflurane; p = 0.02) after discontinuation of anesthesia, although this difference is of little clinical significance.
