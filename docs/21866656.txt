[Clinical study on treatment of endometriosis-related infertility patients by laparoscopic surgery in combination of quyu jiedu recipe].

OBJECTIVE To study the clinical efficacy of the laparoscopic surgery in combination of Quyu Jiedu Recipe (QYJDR) on endometriosis (EMs)-related infertility patients.
METHODS 130 EMs-related infertility patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome diagnosed and treated by laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to two groups, i.e., the test group (75 cases) and the control group (55 cases). All patients received routine progesterone treatment after laparoscopic surgery. QYJDR was given to patients in the test group after laparoscopic surgery, lasting for twelve months. The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery were compared between the two groups. The Chinese medicine syndrome integrals, serum endometrium antibody (EMAb) and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels were compared between before drug therapy and three months after drug therapy.
RESULTS The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery was higher in the test group than in the control group [61.33% (46/75) vs 45.45% (25/55)], showing significant difference (P<0.05). The Chinese medicine syndrome integral was (16.07 +/- 6.77) score and (7.25 +/- 3.27) score before and 3 months after drug therapy in the test group, while it was (15.92 +/- 7.51) score and (12.73 +/- 6.12) score in the control group. The Chinese medicine syndrome integral after drug therapy was lower than that before drug therapy in the same group. Besides, the integral difference between before and after drug therapy was higher in the test group than in the control group [(9.12 +/- 6.16) score vs (3.48 +/- 2.06) score)], showing statistical difference (P<0.05). After three-month drug therapy, the serum EMAb negative conversion rate was obviously higher in the test group than in the control group (44.44% vs 15.62%), showing statistical difference (P<0.05). The serum CA125 level was (31.88 +/- 15.78) U/mL before drug therapy and (18.82 +/- 10.08) U/mL three months after drug therapy in the test group, while it was (30.63 +/- 19.28) U/mL and (18.05 +/- 11.20) U/mL respectively in the control group. It was lowered after drug therapy in the two groups with statistical difference (P<0.05). There was no statistical difference between the two groups after drug therapy (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic surgery in combination of QYJDR could effectively improve clinical symptoms of EMs patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome, promote negative conversion of EMAb, lower serum CA125 levels, and elevate the clinical pregnancy rate. QYJDR is an effective formula in treatment of EMs-related infertility.
