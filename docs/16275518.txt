The evaluation of pulmonary hypertension using right ventricular myocardial isovolumic relaxation time.

Right ventricular (RV) blood pool-derived isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) correlates well with systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). However, because of complex parameter derivation, the method is rarely used. The aim of this study was to validate the measurement of myocardial velocity imaging-derived RV IVRT (IVRT') against invasively measured PAP. Transthoracic echocardiography with myocardial velocity imaging and right heart catheterization were performed in 33 patients with pulmonary hypertension. Blood pool IVRT and myocardial IVRTs for the tricuspid valve annulus ring, basal and apical RV free wall segments were measured and compared with data from 33 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Measured IVRTs were significantly longer in patients with pulmonary hypertension than in control subjects. The strongest correlation (R = 0.74, P < .0001) was found between systolic PAP and the heart rate-corrected IVRT' derived from the basal RV free wall segment. The basal segment IVRT' corrected for heart rate correlates well with the invasive PAP measurement and, therefore, can be used to predict systolic PAP. It can even be considered as an alternative to tricuspid regurgitation-derived PAP systolic when tricuspid regurgitation is nonrecordable. A proposed method to derive systolic PAP should be used while screening the patients at risk for pulmonary hypertension, monitoring the disease progression and the effect of treatment.
