Effect of simvastatin on hemostasis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia.

BACKGROUNDS/AIMS Elevated triglyceride levels seem to predispose to the earlier development and accelerated progression of coronary artery disease. In our study, we assessed for the first time whether simvastatin treatment affects coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia.
METHODS The study included 39 patients with elevated triglyceride levels and peripheral artery sclerosis, treated for 90 days with either simvastatin (40 mg daily) or placebo. Plasma lipids, glucose homeostasis markers and hemostasic variables were assessed at baseline and after treatment.
RESULTS Simvastatin, but not placebo, administered to these patients reduced plasma levels/activity of fibrinogen (from 3.5 ± 0.4 to 2.8 ± 0.3 g/l, p < 0.01), factor VII (from 144.2 ± 16.9 to 112.5 ± 14.0%, p < 0.01) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (from 76.9 ± 13.5 to 50.2 ± 9.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001), without a significant reduction in von Willebrand factor levels, and tended to prolong the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times.
CONCLUSION Our results suggest that statin treatment produces a multidirectional effect on coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia and that this treatment may bring some benefits to patients with elevated triglyceride levels.
