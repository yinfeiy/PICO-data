Timing for delivering individualized patient education intervention to Coronary Artery Bypass Graft patients: An RCT.

BACKGROUND The primary focus of this study is on the timing of the delivery of education to patients who had CABG surgery.
AIM To determine the efficacy of an individualized telephone patient education intervention, delivered at two different points in time (1-2 days pre-discharge versus 1-2 days post-discharge) in enhancing the CABG patient's knowledge of self-care behaviours, performance of self-care behaviours, and symptom frequency.
METHOD A randomized clinical trial that included a convenience sample of first time CABG patients. Individuals who received education pre-discharge were compared to individuals who received education post-discharge on the outcomes.
RESULTS Results indicated no statistically significant difference in outcomes between the two time points. As well, anxiety levels were found to be significantly higher in the pre-discharge group than the post-discharge group.
CONCLUSIONS The individualized nature of the educational intervention may have accounted for non-significant findings reported in outcomes between the two time points.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Nurses may consider assessing anxiety levels prior to delivery of educational interventions, implement interventions aimed at reducing anxiety levels, and provide individualized teaching.
