Serum biochemical characteristics of Beluga, Huso huso (L.), in response to blood sampling after clove powder solution exposure.

In order to investigate the effect of anesthesia on serum parameters, Beluga, Huso huso (L.) were blood-sampled immediately without anesthesia (control) or subjected to following anesthesia procedure: 40, 120, and 240 s exposure to 3,000, 700, and 500 mg l⁻¹ clove solution, respectively. Blood samples were collected after these periods, when fish were immobile and reached stage 4 anesthesia. Results showed that cortisol and glucose levels were significantly high in 700 and 500 but not 3,000 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control. Serum lactate levels were significantly high in 500 mg l⁻¹ group compared to control group. Lactate levels were not significantly differed between control, 3,000, and 700 mg l⁻¹ groups. There were no significant differences in serum levels of cholesterol, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, Na⁺, Cl⁻, K⁺, and Ca²⁺. Results suggest that rapid anesthesia with higher dose is better than slow anesthesia with lower dose for blood sampling in Beluga.
