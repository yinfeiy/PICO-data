A randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study of ganitumab or conatumumab in combination with FOLFIRI for second-line treatment of mutant KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND Targeted agents presently available for mutant KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are bevacizumab and aflibercept. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of conatumumab (an agonistic monoclonal antibody against human death receptor 5) and ganitumab (a monoclonal antibody against the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor) combined with standard FOLFIRI chemotherapy as a second-line treatment in patients with mutant KRAS mCRC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with mutant KRAS metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum refractory to fluoropyrimidine- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to receive intravenous FOLFIRI plus conatumumab 10 mg/kg (Arm A), ganitumab 12 mg/kg (Arm B), or placebo (Arm C) Q2W. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS In total, 155 patients were randomized. Median PFS in Arms A, B, and C was 6.5 months (HR, 0.69; P = 0.147), 4.5 months (HR, 1.01; P = 0.998), and 4.6 months, respectively; median overall survival was 12.3 months (HR, 0.89; P = 0.650), 12.4 months (HR, 1.27; P = 0.357), and 12.0 months; and objective response rate was 14%, 8%, and 2%. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events in Arms A/B/C included neutropenia (30%/25%/18%) and diarrhea (18%/2%/10%).
CONCLUSIONS Conatumumab, but not ganitumab, plus FOLFIRI was associated with a trend toward improved PFS. Both combinations had acceptable toxicity.
