Reduced platelet thromboxane formation after long-term administration of a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker: a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with nitrendipine in borderline hypertensive patients with IDDM-type diabetes mellitus.

Twenty-nine IDDM patients with borderline hypertension were randomly allocated to placebo or nitrendipine treatment. Nitrendipine was given orally at a dosage of 20 mg once daily over 4 weeks. Stimulated platelet thromboxane formation at rest and after standardized, non exhausting exercise was measured by standard methods. In addition, plasma levels of platelet factor 4 and aggregation responses to collagen and ADP were determined. In the treatment group thromboxane formation after stimulation with collagen (0.3 and 1.0 micrograms/ml) and 1 mM arachidonic acid (AA) was reduced in the resting state. Exercise induced change of thromboxane synthesis in response to 1.0 micrograms/ml collagen was significantly lower as compared to placebo (p < 0.05). In parallel, PF4 plasma levels were significantly lowered (p < 0.05). Whole blood aggregation after collagen stimulation (1.0 micrograms/ml) was reduced after 4 weeks of nitrendipine treatment, but ADP (5 microM) induced aggregation was not. These effects of nitrendipine were not seen in platelet rich plasma. In conclusion long-term nitrendipine treatment may inhibit collagen dependent platelet activation in the blood of diabetic patients with borderline hypertension.
