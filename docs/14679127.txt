Long-term survival in a phase III, randomised study of topotecan versus paclitaxel in advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma.

BACKGROUND We have continued to monitor the survival of patients randomised in a previously reported multicentre phase III study of topotecan versus paclitaxel in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who had failed one prior platinum-based regimen.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with bidimensionally measurable disease were randomised to topotecan (1.5 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)/day as a 3-h infusion) every 21 days. Patients were eligible for treatment with the alternate therapy at third line. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QOL)-C30 questionnaire was also used to measure eight symptoms at baseline and during each course (pain, anorexia, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, constipation and insomnia).
RESULTS A total of 226 patients were evaluable for response. Demographic characteristics were similar in both treatment groups, as were results of the EORTC QOL-30 questionnaire. For the topotecan group, median time to progression was 18.9 weeks (range <1 to 92.6+ weeks; 25% censored), and, for paclitaxel, 14.7 weeks (range <1 to 137.3+ weeks; 12.3% censored); P = 0.076. At 4 years post-randomisation, median survival in the topotecan group was 63.0 weeks (range <1 to 238.4+ weeks; 20.5% censored) and, for paclitaxel, 53.0 weeks (range <1 to 226.3+ weeks; 12.3% censored); P = 0.44.
CONCLUSION Topotecan continues to demonstrate comparable efficacy and survival to paclitaxel with manageable and non-cumulative haematological toxicity. Non-haematological toxicity was generally mild for both groups. The long-term survival rate indicates substantial therapeutic benefit for this group of patients receiving topotecan at relapse of ovarian cancer.
