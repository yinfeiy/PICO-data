Levobunolol compared with timolol: a four-year study.

Fifty-one patients with raised intraocular pressure (IOP) were treated for up to four years with one of three ophthalmic solutions: 0.5% levobunolol, 1% levobunolol, or 0.5% timolol. The study was conducted as a double-masked, randomised trial in which medications were administered twice daily to both eyes. Levobunolol and timolol were equally effective in reducing overall mean IOP; reductions were greater than 8.8 mmHg in all three treatment groups. The study showed levobunolol to be as safe and effective as timolol in the long-term control of raised IOP.
