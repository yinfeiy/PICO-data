[Effect of branch chain amino acid enriched formula on postoperative fatigue and nutritional status after digestive surgery].

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of branch chain amino acid (BCAA) enriched formula on nutritional status and postoperative fatigue for digestive surgery patients.
METHODS Forty patients who underwent digestive surgery were randomly received parenteral nutrition with either BCAA enriched (study group, n=20) or routine amino acid (control group, n=20) for seven consecutive days. Nitrogen balance,serum total protein, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, retinol binding protein and postoperative fatigue score were monitored during the postoperative period.
RESULTS The cumulative postoperative fatigue scores were lower in BCAA group than that in the control group at the 4th, 5th and 7th day after operation (P< 0.05). Patients achieved positive nitrogen balance 2 days earlier in the study group than that in the control group, but there was no significant difference in cumulative nitrogen balance between the two groups. There was no significant difference in elevation of serum total protein, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin at the 7th day after operation between the two groups (P > 0.05), compared with those at the first day after operation. The serum level of retinol binding protein was higher in BCAA-enriched group than that in the control group (P=0.004).
CONCLUSION TPN with BCAA enriched formula can reduce postoperative fatigue score and improve the nutritional status for digestive surgery patients.
