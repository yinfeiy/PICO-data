[Improving wound healing after nose surgery by combined administration of xylometazoline and dexpanthenol].

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was the examination of efficacy and tolerability of an application-form of the new combination of Xylometazoline with Dexpanthenol (Nasic) versus Xylometazoline alone.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Randomized verum controlled parallel-group-comparison of two weeks treatment of a nasal-spray. 61 inpatients with the diagnosis Rhinitis following nasal operation were included in this study and 30 patients were treated with verum and placebo each. The assessment of nasal-breathing-resistance according to scores was defined as target-parameter. Confirmatory statistical analysis was carried out according to Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-U two-sided at alpha < or = 0.05.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The superiority of the combination of Xylometazoline-Dexpanthenol nasal-spray versus Xylometazoline nasal spray could be proven for the target-parameter as clinically relevant and statistically significant. The clinically proven efficacy is emphasized by good tolerability of both treatments. Due to easy handling of the nasal-spray a good compliance was confirmed.
CONCLUSION Distinct improvement of symptoms in patients following nasal operations underlines the efficacy of both medications. With respect to the tolerability therapy with the combination is more beneficial in comparison to the alternative therapy. The result of this controlled clinical study confirms that the combination Xylometazoline-Dexpanthenol is an enlargement and improvement of effective medicinal treatment of rhinitis following nasal operation in comparison to therapy with Xylometazoline alone.
