The treatment of asthma in adults using sodium cromoglycate pressurized aerosol: a double-blind controlled trial.

Sodium cromoglycate formulated as a pressurized aerosol (2 mg 4-times daily) and placebo were compared in 31 adult asthmatic patients in a double-blind crossover trial lasting 12 weeks. Sodium cromoglycate was superior to placebo in improving breathlessness at rest (p less than 0.001), breathlessness on exertion (p less than 0.05) and the quality of sleep (p less than 0.001), and also in improving the morning peak expiratory flow rate value (p less than 0.05). Both the patients' (p less than 0.05) and the clinicians' (p less than 0.01) treatment opinions, and their treatment preferences (p less than 0.05), favoured sodium cromoglycate. Moreover, usage of bronchodilators (theophylline and aerosol beta-stimulants combined) declined significantly (p less than 0.001) during sodium cromoglycate treatment compared to placebo. No side-effects were reported. The results of this study show that sodium cromoglycate delivered by pressurized aerosol was significantly superior to placebo, not only in improving asthmatic symptoms, but also in reducing the amount of concomitant bronchodilator therapy required.
