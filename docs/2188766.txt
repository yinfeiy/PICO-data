Chronic vasodilator therapy with flosequinan in congestive heart failure.

This study was conducted to determine the long-term effect of flosequinan, a new orally administered arterial and venous dilator, on the clinical course of patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure. Seventeen patients on chronic digitalis and diuretic therapy were randomized to receive either flosequinan (n = 9) or placebo (n = 8) in a double-blind fashion. Changes in symptomatology, exercise performance, and left ventricular function were assessed serially during the two-month treatment period. During the course of therapy, a modest improvement in the symptom scores and functional classification of the flosequinan-treated patients was observed. Flosequinan evoked a significant increase in maximal exercise capacity. While long-term flosequinan administration also effected a progressive increase in resting heart rate, it did not consistently improve indices of left ventricular systolic function. The addition of chronic vasodilator therapy with flosequinan to standard digitalis-diuretic regimens is capable of inducing clinical improvement in patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure. Trials involving larger patient populations will be necessary to confirm the results of this preliminary study and to determine the extent of clinical improvement, subpopulations benefited, role in heart failure therapeutics, and so forth.
