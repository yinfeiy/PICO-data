Treatment of men with flat (FC) or acuminata (CA) condylomata with interferon alpha-2a.

This study was undertaken to assess the effect of CO2 laser vaporization, 5-fluorouracil 5% (5-FU) topical application and Interferon alpha-2a (IFA alpha-2a) in the treatment of C.A. or F.C. of the male genital tract. From March 1986 to September 1991, 1372 men, sexual partners of women with F.C. or C.A. or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, were submitted to peoscopy. One thousand and nineteen (74.27%) men presented with various penile lesions caused by HPV (histologically confirmed); of these 505 were treated for C.A. or F.C. or a combination of F.C. and C.A. The best treatment modalities, irrespective of the kind of lesion, were found to be the combination of 5-FU plus IFN alpha-2a (high dose) (98.27%), the combination of CO2 laser vaporization plus 5-FU plus IFN alpha-2a (high dose) (93.93%) and the combination of CO2 laser vaporization plus 5-FU (87.23%). In conclusion we believe that IFN alpha-2a can be used with excellent results as first line treatment in combination with CO2 laser vaporization or/plus 5-FU in patients with C.A. or F.C. or combined condylomata.
