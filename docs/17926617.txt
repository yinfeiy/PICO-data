[Effects of electroacupuncture combined with behavior therapy on intelligence and behavior of children of autism].

OBJECTIVE To find out an effective therapy for autism.
METHODS Sixty children of autism were randomly divided into an electroacupuncture (EA) plus behavior therapy group and a behavior therapy group, 30 cases in each group. The patients in the two groups were treated with routine behavior, with EA at Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Shenting (GV 24), Benshen (GB 13), Yintang (EX-HN 3), Naohu (GV 17), Naokong (GB 19), Neiguan (PC 6) and scalp acupuncture at Speech Areas I, II, III added for the EA plus behavior therapy group. Their therapeutic effects were observed, and the picture and vocabulary scale (PPVT) and behavior ability were detected.
RESULTS The total effective rate was 86.7% in the EA plus behavior therapy group which was better than 56.7% of the behavior therapy group, and had significant enhancement in sensation, association, body, and ability of self-care (P < 0.05) and was better than the behavior therapy group in sensation, body and self-care factors, with no significantly improvement in the scores of PPVT in the two groups (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION EA combined with behavior therapy can significantly improve clinical symptoms of autism, but does not improve intelligence.
