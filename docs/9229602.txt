[Antazoline/tetryzoline eyedrops in comparison with levocabastine eyedrops in acute allergic conjunctivitis].

BACKGROUND Allergic conjunctivitis is one of the most frequent allergic diseases of the anterior eye segment.

The subjective and objective ocular symptoms were documented over the treatment period.
RESULTS Both eye drops reduced subjective and objective ocular symptoms effective. The difference between the treatments (p = 0.0395) was the faster onset of action of Antazolin/Tetryzolin 30 minutes after administration of the first drop of trial medication.
CONCLUSION A fast and effective onset of action is of high clinical relevance. Therefore the benefits of using Antazolin/Tetryzolin eye drops was clearly outweigh.
