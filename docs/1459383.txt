The effects of treatment of urinary incontinence in general practice.

A total of 110 women who had reported urinary incontinence to their general practitioners were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Treatment consisted of pelvic floor exercises in the case of stress incontinence and bladder training in the case of urge incontinence. The results were measured after 3 and 12 months by a research assistant on the basis of a constructed severity scale, an incontinence diary, and a comparison by the patients themselves of their previous and current conditions. After 3 months the control group were given the same treatment. After a further 3 and 12 months, they were assessed in exactly the same way as the treatment group. After 3 months about 60% of the patients were either dry or only mildly incontinent; the mean number of wet episodes had gone down from 20 to 7, and 74% of the women felt improved or cured. These results were later corroborated by the control group. After 12 months this successful outcome was improved slightly further. It may be concluded that the majority of women with incontinence can be successfully treated by the general practitioner. The effect of this treatment continues after one year.
