Music or guided imagery for women undergoing colposcopy: a randomized controlled study of effects on anxiety, perceived pain, and patient satisfaction.

OBJECTIVE It was hypothesized that music or guided imagery versus usual care would result in less anxiety and perceived pain for colposcopy patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients were randomized to music, guided imagery, or usual care after completing a baseline questionnaire. All patients completed a postprocedure questionnaire.
RESULTS Study participants (N=170) had a mean age of 28.4 years (SD=9.6; range 18-60) and formed a racially diverse group. Education/income levels were low. No between-group differences were found for postprocedure anxiety or pain rating.
CONCLUSIONS Mind-body interventions had no statistically significant impact on reported anxiety, perceived pain, or satisfaction with care, even for those who anticipated the most pain or started with high anxiety.
