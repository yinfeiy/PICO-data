Comparison of three-year clinical outcomes between sirolimus-versus paclitaxel-eluting stents in diabetic patients: prospective randomized multicenter trial.

BACKGROUND Three-year follow-up of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization) and the predictors of MACEs in diabetic patients after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) or paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) implantation have not been reported.
METHODS Diabetic patients with de novo coronary lesions (169 patients with 190 lesions) were randomly assigned prospectively to either SES or PES.
RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. The rates of MACEs [5.9% (n = 5) in the SES vs. 9.5% (n = 8) in the PES Group, P = 0.374] and definite stent thrombosis [1.2% (n = 1) in the SES vs. 3.6% (n = 3) in the PES Group, P = 0.368] were similar in the two groups during the three-year follow-up. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that insulin treatment was the only independent predictor of MACE [odds ratio (OR) 8.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.25-22.76, P < 0.001] and target vessel revascularization (TVR) (OR 9.50, 95% CI 3.07-29.44, P < 0.001) during the three-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS The rates of MACEs, TVR, and stent thrombosis during the three-year follow-up were similar in the SES and PES Groups. Insulin treatment was a main predictor of MACEs and TVR during the three-year follow-up after either SES or PES implantation.
