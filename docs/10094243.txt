Epinephrine-induced panic attacks and hyperventilation.

To assess the effects of epinephrine on ventilation in patients with panic disorder and in social phobics, analyses were performed on pooled data from two previous infusion studies. Throughout the infusion, changes in transcutaneous PCO2 (tcPCO2), subjective anxiety, heart rate and blood pressure were recorded continuously. Twenty-nine patients received epinephrine, ten patients received placebo. Thirteen patients (45%) had a panic attack during epinephrine. The fall in tcPCO2 and the cardiovascular response was greater in panicking patients than patients who did not panic. Although the fall in tcPCO2 associated with panic was not substantial and did not indicate clinically significant acute hyperventilation, it appears to be a sensitive index for epinephrine-induced panic. The fall in tcPCO2 was predicted rather by the frequency of occurrence of anxiety-related somatic symptoms than by the fear of these symptoms. These findings further reduce a role for fear of bodily sensations in epinephrine-induced panic attacks and favor a biological sensitivity to sympathetic stimulation.
