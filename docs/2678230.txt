[The effect of ionic and nonionic x-ray contrast media on myocardial perfusion and myocardial function].

The influence of injections of Amidotrizoate and Iopromide into the left coronary artery on global myocardial perfusion and function (pressures in the left ventricle, heart rate) as well as excitation formation and transmission was studied in 16 patients with ischaemic heart disease. No statistically significant differences in myocardial perfusion measured were found with xenon-133 in this small group between rest and dipyridamole load for ionic and non-ionic contrast media.
