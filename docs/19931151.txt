Tetracaine (ametop) compared to placebo for reducing pain associated with intramuscular injection of palivizumab (synagis).

Infants receive many painful immunizations before they are 2 years old. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if topical tetracaine reduces the pain of intramuscular palivizumab compared to placebo. There were two study injections, one with tetracaine and one with placebo. Pain was scored by their parents and a pediatric nurse. Topical tetracaine was not associated with a significant reduction in pain score, although it did lead to faster recovery times. Additional pain-reduction strategies are required.
