Effect of antipyretic drugs in children with malaria.

A comparison of different antipyretics in children with malaria showed a small effect of naproxen, but not of metamizol, on the reduction of fever peaks. Antipyretic treatment had no effect on fever clearance and therefore should be used cautiously in the treatment of malaria.
