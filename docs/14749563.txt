The long-term effect of oxandrolone on hepatic acute phase proteins in severely burned children.

BACKGROUND Acute phase protein production is a hallmark of severe burns. We wondered whether anabolic treatment with oxandrolone would affect these proteins.
METHODS Thirty-five children with > or =40% total body surface area burns were randomized to receive either placebo or oxandrolone (0.1 mg/kg by mouth twice daily) from postoperative day 5 to 1 year postburn. Levels of constitutive proteins and acute phase proteins were measured at admission; at discharge; and at 6, 9, and 12 months after burn. Total albumin supplementation and hepatic transaminases were also assessed.
RESULTS Constitutive proteins such as albumin, prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein levels increased (p < 0.05), and acute phase proteins such as alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, C3 complement, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and fibrinogen levels significantly decreased in the oxandrolone group compared with placebo (p < 0.05). Albumin supplementation during the acute hospitalization was reduced in the oxandrolone group. Hepatic transaminases remained within normal levels.
CONCLUSION Treatment with oxandrolone in severe burns significantly increases constitutive protein and reduces acute phase protein levels.
