Peritonsillar infiltration with bupivacaine for paediatric tonsillectomy.

In a double-blind study forty-two children scheduled for elective adenotonsillectomy were randomized to receive peritonsillar infiltration, following induction of anaesthesia, with either 0.25% plain bupivacaine or 0.9% saline, 0.5 ml/kg to a maximum of 10 ml. The children were assessed on awakening, and then 10 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours and 24 hours later. On each occasion the observer gave the child a pain score from 1 (no pain) to 5 (severe pain). The scores on awakening and after 10 minutes were significantly lower in the bupivacaine group (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Thereafter there was no difference between the groups. The authors conclude that peritonsillar infiltration with bupivacaine is only moderately useful as analgesia for children having tonsillectomy.
