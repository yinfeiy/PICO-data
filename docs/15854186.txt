Cophenylcaine spray vs. placebo in flexible nasendoscopy: a prospective double-blind randomised controlled trial.

Practices vary across the UK on the use of topical preparation prior to flexible fibreoptic nasendoscopy. In this double-blind study, we randomised 98 patients to receive cophenylcaine or placebo nasal spray before flexible nasendoscopy. A visual analogue scale (1-100) was used to record pain, unpleasantness of taste and overall discomfort experienced. Overall, the procedure was associated with minimal pain and discomfort in both groups. There was no significant difference in pain or overall discomfort experienced between the two groups; however, the sensation of bad taste was significantly worse in the cophenylcaine group. In linear regression, factors that predicted the overall unpleasantness of the experience were primarily pain experienced and secondarily unpleasantness of taste. We conclude that the routine use of cophenylcaine for nasal preparation is not justified before flexible nasendoscopy.
