Pharmacogenetic interaction analysis for the efficacy of systemic treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND Pharmacogenetic markers related to drug metabolism and mechanisms of action could help to better select patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) for treatment. Genetic interaction analysis is used as a rational tool to study the contribution of polygenic variation in relation to drug response.
PATIENTS AND METHODS A selection of 17 polymorphisms in genes encoding drug targets, pathway molecules and detoxification enzymes was analyzed in 279 previously untreated mCRC patients treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab (CAPOX-B). Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis was used to identify a genetic interaction profile for progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS Median PFS was 10.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4-12.4] months. A genetic interaction profile consisting of the TYMS enhancer region and VEGF +405G>C polymorphisms was significantly associated with PFS. Median PFS was 13.3 (95% CI 11.4-15.3) and 9.7 (95% CI 7.6-11.8) months for the beneficial and unfavorable genetic profiles, respectively, corresponding to a hazards ratio for PFS of 1.58 (95% CI 1.14-2.19). None of the studied polymorphisms were individually associated with PFS.
CONCLUSIONS Our results support a genetic interaction between the TYMS enhancer region and VEGF +405G>C polymorphisms as a predictor of the efficacy of CAPOX-B in mCRC patients.
