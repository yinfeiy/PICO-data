Pharmacokinetic properties of YM17E, an inhibitor of acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyl transferase, and serum cholesterol levels in healthy volunteers.

We conducted a single and repeat oral dose study of YM17E, a novel inhibitor of acyl coenzyme A (CoA): cholesterol acyltransferase, in healthy male volunteers to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, tolerability and effect of the drug on serum cholesterol. In the single administration study, YM17E was administered after a meal to two groups of subjects (each containing six subjects taking the drug and three taking placebo) receiving 3, 60 and 300 mg or 15, 60 and 450 mg YM17E, respectively. Plasma concentrations of unchanged drug following single oral administration at 3-300 mg after a meal increased with increasing dose. In contrast, plasma concentrations after administration of 450 mg were almost the same as after 300 mg. Unchanged YM17E was not detected in urine after single administration, suggesting that it was excreted via the bile or urine after metabolism. Five active metabolites (M1, M2-a, M2-b, M3 and M4) were observed in plasma at concentrations comparable to those of unchanged YM17E. Their plasma concentrations increased in a slightly greater than dose-dependent manner from 3 to 300 mg. The effect of food was studied in an open crossover design with a 1-week washout period. Twelve subjects received 150 mg YM17E in both the fasted and post-prandial states. The AUC and Cmax after fasting were closely similar to those after a meal, showing that bioavailability was not affected by food intake. In the repeated oral dose study, the subjects received test drug at 150 mg or 300 mg (n = 6 each) or placebo (n = 3) twice a day (after breakfast and after dinner) for 7 days. On days 1 and 7, the subjects received YM17E once a day (after breakfast) for evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties. After repeated oral administration of 150 mg b.d., plasma concentrations reached steady state by day 5 (mean Cmin 48.6 ng.ml-1). After repeated administration of 300 mg b.d., plasma concentrations prior to each daily morning dose increased up to the 5th day (mean Cmin 166.6 ng.ml-1) and then tended to decrease until the 7th day. No significant signs, symptoms or changes in serum cholesterol levels were observed during the single and repeated oral dose studies at 150 mg b.d. Although statistical analysis was not conducted because of the small number of subjects, all subjects receiving repeated oral administration of 300 mg twice daily showed a 25% decrease in serum cholesterol level on day 7, but also the simultaneous occurrence of diarrhoea.
