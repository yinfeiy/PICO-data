Effects of dietary pyridoxine on haemato-immunological responses of Labeo rohita fingerlings reared at higher water temperature.

A sixty-day feeding trial was carried out to elucidate the effect of dietary pyridoxine (PN) on hemato-immunological parameters in Labeo rohita fingerlings exposed to an elevated temperature (ET) of 33 °C. Two hundred and seventy fingerlings (6.71 ± 0.32 g) were randomly distributed into six treatments in triplicates (15 fish/tank). Five iso-nitrogenous (356.3 ± 2.7 g/kg crude protein) purified diets were prepared with graded levels (0, 10, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg diet) of PN. Six treatment groups were P10T26 (10 mg PN + ambient temperature (26 °C), P0T33 (0 mg PN + ET), P10T33 (10 mg PN + ET), P50T33 (50 mg PN + ET), P100T33 (100 mg PN + ET) and P200T33 (200 mg PN + ET). The responses of L. rohita fingerlings to dietary PN were assessed in terms of growth and by analysing some hemato-immunological parameters. When PN supplementation increased from 10 to 200 mg/kg diet, a significant improvement in weight gain percentage was observed. Erythrocyte (RBC) count, leucocyte (WBC) count, haemoglobin content and respiratory burst activity were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in 100 mg PN/kg diet-fed group than their non-PN-fed counterpart. Also, serum albumin, globulin and lysozyme activity were found significantly (p < 0.05) higher in PN-fed groups. The overall results indicated that dietary PN supplementation at 100 mg/kg diet may reverse the negative effects caused by ET and may protect the haemato-immunological status of L. rohita fingerlings reared at higher water temperature.
