The effect of prethrombolytic cyclosporine-A injection on clinical outcome of acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

INTRODUCTION Reperfusion injury reduces the benefits of early reperfusion therapies after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Cyclosporine-A (CsA) is a potent inhibitor of opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which has been shown to play a key role in myocardial reperfusion injury. The impact of this treatment on clinical outcomes of acute STEMI remains unknown. Our aim was to investigate the clinical outcomes of using this drug in patients with acute anterior STEMI receiving thrombolytic treatment (TLT).
METHODS In this double-blinded randomized clinical trial, 101 patients with acute anterior STEMI who were candidate for TLT, were enrolled and randomly assigned into treatment or control groups. Patients in the treatment group received an intravenous bolus injection of 2.5 mg/kg of CsA immediately before TLT. The patients in the control group received an equivalent volume of normal saline. Infarct size, occurrence of major arrhythmias, heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), TLT-related complications, in-hospital and 6-month mortality rates were investigated.
RESULTS There were no significant differences among the demographics, myocardial enzyme release, occurrence of major arrhythmias [9 (18%) vs. 12 (23.5%), P = 0.80], heart failure [18 (36%) vs. 19 (38.3%), P = 0.83], LVEF at first day [34.7 ± 9.9% vs. 33.5 ± 8.1%, P = 0.50] or at discharge [37.7 ± 10% vs. 36.1 ± 8.2%, P = 0.43], and in-hospital [4 (8%) vs. 6 (11.8%), P = 0.74] or 6-month mortality rates [9 (18%) vs. 10 (19.6%), P = 0.99] between the CsA vs. the control group.
CONCLUSION In this study, the prethrombolytic administration of CsA was not associated with a reduction in the infarct size or any improvement in clinical outcomes.
