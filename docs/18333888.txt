The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor PHX1149 improves blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AIM To determine the efficacy and tolerability of PHX1149, a novel dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week study in patients with type 2 diabetes with suboptimal metabolic control. Patients with a baseline haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) of 7.3 to 11.0% were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 to receive once-daily oral therapy with either PHX1149 (100, 200 or 400 mg) or placebo; patients were on a constant background therapy of either metformin alone or metformin plus a glitazone.
RESULTS Treatment with 100, 200 or 400 mg of PHX1149 significantly decreased postprandial glucose area under the curve AUC(0-2 h) by approximately 20% (+0.11 +/- 0.50, -2.08 +/- 0.51, -1.73 +/- 0.49 and -1.88 +/- 0.48 mmol/l x h, respectively, for placebo and 100, 200 and 400 mg (p = 0.002, 0.008 and 0.004 vs. placebo). Postprandial AUC(0-2 h) of intact glucagon-like peptide-1, the principal mediator of the biological effects of DPP4 inhibitors, was increased by 3.90 +/- 2.83, 11.63 +/- 2.86, 16.42 +/- 2.72 and 15.75 +/- 2.71 pmol/l x h, respectively, for placebo and 100, 200 and 400 mg (p = 0.053, 0.001 and 0.002 vs. placebo). Mean HbA(1c) was lower in all dose groups; the placebo-corrected change in the groups receiving 400 mg PHX1149 was -0.28% (p = 0.02). DPP4 inhibition on day 28 was 53, 73 and 78% at 24 h postdose in the groups receiving 100, 200 and 400 mg PHX1149, respectively. There were no differences in adverse events between PHX1149-treated and placebo subjects.
CONCLUSIONS Addition of the DPP4 inhibitor PHX1149 to a stable regimen of metformin or metformin plus a glitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes was well tolerated and improved blood glucose control.
