Transitions during effective treatment for cocaine-abusing homeless persons: establishing abstinence, lapse, and relapse, and reestablishing abstinence.

Data are reported on drug use among cocaine-dependent homeless persons who participated in a clinical trial that compared day treatment only (DT, n = 69) with day treatment plus abstinent-contingent housing and work (DT+, n = 72). Drug use was measured with multiple weekly urine toxicologies. Compared with DT participants, more DT+ participants established abstinence, maintained abstinence for longer durations, were marginally significantly more likely to lapse, and significantly less likely to relapse. Of all participants who established abstinence and then relapsed, DT+ participants relapsed later and were more likely to reestablish abstinence. These analyses yield information on the processes involved in the manner in which drug use changes as a result of abstinent-contingent housing and work.
