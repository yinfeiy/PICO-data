Cancer information and anxiety: applying the extended parallel process model.

There is concern that public education about testicular cancer (TC) may cause unnecessary anxiety. Psychological theory suggests that if threat (eg, TC) information is accompanied with threat control strategies (eg, testicular self-examination; TSE) anxiety is less likely. Male students (N=443) were randomized to either a TC or TC +TSE information group or a no information control group, and assessed at three time points. Anxiety levels did not differ between the groups and exposure to TC+TSE resulted in greater perceived message benefit, increased intention to self-examine and lower message denigration. This suggests TC information is not anxiogenic, but inclusion of TSE information may improve acceptance of disease awareness information.
