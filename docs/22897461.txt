Effect of rosuvastatin monotherapy or in combination with fenofibrate or ω-3 fatty acids on lipoprotein subfraction profile in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome.

BACKGROUND Raised triglycerides (TG), decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and a predominance of small dense low density lipoproteins (sdLDL) are characteristics of the metabolic syndrome (MetS).
OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of high-dose rosuvastatin monotherapy with moderate dosing combined with fenofibrate or ω-3 fatty acids on the lipoprotein subfraction profile in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia and MetS.
METHODS We previously randomised patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > 160 and TG > 200 mg/dl to rosuvastatin monotherapy 40 mg/day (R group, n = 30) or rosuvastatin 10 mg/day combined with fenofibrate 200 mg/day (RF group, n = 30) or ω-3 fatty acids 2 g/day (Rω group, n = 30). In the present study, only patients with MetS were included (24, 23 and 24 in the R, RF and Rω groups respectively). At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment, the lipoprotein subfraction profile was determined by polyacrylamide 3% gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS The mean LDL size was significantly increased in all groups. This change was more prominent with RF than with other treatments in parallel with its greater hypotriglyceridemic capacity (p < 0.05 compared with R and Rω). A decrease in insulin resistance by RF was also noted. Only RF significantly raised HDL-C levels (by 7.7%, p < 0.05) by increasing the cholesterol of small HDL particles. The cholesterol of larger HDL subclasses was significantly increased by R and Rω.
CONCLUSIONS All regimens increased mean LDL size; RF was the most effective. A differential effect of treatments was noted on the HDL subfraction profile.
