Sedation during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography : a randomized controlled study of patient - controlled propofol sedation and that given by a nurse anesthetist . 
<br>
<br> OBJECTIVE Different regimens are used for sedation during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) . Our objectives were to compare safety , ease of treatment , recovery , and patients ' experiences using patient - controlled sedation ( PCS ) with propofol , nurse anesthetist - controlled sedation ( ACS ) , or the department 's standard of care , midazolam given by the procedure team ( control group ) . 
<br> MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included <font color="red">281_2</font> <font color="red">adults_2</font> <font color="red">in_1</font> <font color="red">301_1</font> <font color="red">procedures_1</font> <font color="red">._1</font> The PCS group ( n = 101 ) delivered bolus doses of 5 mg of propofol according to their need for sedation . The ACS group ( n = 100 ) had 2 - 8 mg / kg / h of propofol infused , with the target for sedation being level 3 of the Observer 's Assessment of Alertness / Sedation ( OAA / S ) scale . The control group was given 2 - 3 mg of midazolam for induction and additional 1 mg if required . 
<br> RESULTS PCS and ACS increased the ease of the procedure and reduced the number of sedation failures compared to midazolam sedation ( ACS n = 0 ; PCS n = 4 ; midazolam n = 20 ) . The ACS group had more deeply sedated patients ( OAA / S level 2 ) , desaturation , and obstructed airways than the PCS and midazolam groups . Time to full recovery ( Aldrete score ≥9 ) was shortest following PCS . PCS resulted in the least fatigue and pain after the procedure . Patients ' preference for PCS and ACS was the same . 
<br> CONCLUSION PCS with propofol is superior to midazolam and comparable to ACS . PCS resulted in a rapid recovery , fewer respiratory events , and was almost as effective as ACS in ensuring a successful examination .
